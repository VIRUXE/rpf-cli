# rage-cli

A fast, safe, and cross-platform command-line tool for RAGE game files — RPF archives and what is inside them — written in Rust.

> Renamed from `rpf-cli` in 0.16: the binary is now `rage`, the config directory `~/.rage-cli`
> (an existing `~/.rpf-cli` keeps being used) and the environment variables `RAGE_*`
> (`RPF_*` still read). The library code moved to [`rpf-archive`](https://github.com/VIRUXE/rpf-archive-rs)
> (archives), [`rage-formats`](https://github.com/VIRUXE/rage-formats) (RSC7 resources) and
> [`rage-render`](https://github.com/VIRUXE/rage-render) (rasteriser, sheets, glTF).

It reads GTA V's RPF7 archives (including the encrypted retail ones, given your own game install), finds files
across nested archives without extracting them, pulls textures out as ordinary images, and renders models to
pictures from the terminal — no CodeWalker, no GPU.

Currently, this tool is a work in progress and only supports RPF7 archives (GTA V).

Drop a star if you've found this tool useful.

## Install

Prebuilt Windows and Linux binaries are attached to every
[release](https://github.com/VIRUXE/rage-cli/releases). Or build from source:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/VIRUXE/rage-cli
```

Already installed? `rage update install` replaces the binary in place with the
latest release — see [Updating](#updating).

## Commands

```

Reading retail game archives needs keys — see [Keys](#keys). Archives that are not
encrypted, such as FiveM resource packs, need no setup at all.

The examples below use `<GTA V>` for the game folder, e.g.
`C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Grand Theft Auto V`, with
`GTAV_PATH` pointing at it.

## Examples

### Look inside an archive

```sh
rage info mp_biker_weed.rpf
rage tree mp_biker_weed.rpf
rage list mp_biker_weed.rpf "*bag*"
```

```

### Find anything, anywhere

`list` only sees one archive's top level. `search` descends into nested `.rpf`
entries in memory, and takes a directory to cover every archive under it:

```sh
rage search "<GTA V>/x64c.rpf" "prop_cs_heist_bag*" -d    # which nested rpf holds it, with details
rage search "<GTA V>" "*.ymt" --json                       # every .ymt in the whole install
rage search "<GTA V>/x64a.rpf" --content binoculars -i     # bytes inside files (resources are inflated)
rage search "<GTA V>/x64b.rpf" --hex "52 53 43 37" --limit 5
rage search "<GTA V>/x64a.rpf" --hash 0x6D8A1F3C           # JOAAT of a name or stem
```

```
Path                                                                  Size   MemSize  Type      Hash
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<GTA V>/x64c.rpf:x64c.rpf/levels/gta5/props/lev_des/lev_des.rpf/prop_cs_heist_bag_01.ydr        170163  65536  Resource  0xE81D7506
<GTA V>/x64c.rpf:x64c.rpf/levels/gta5/props/lev_des/lev_des.rpf/prop_cs_heist_bag_02+hidr.ytd   548154   8192  Resource  0xA798254B
<GTA V>/x64c.rpf:x64c.rpf/levels/gta5/props/lev_des/lev_des.rpf/prop_cs_heist_bag_02.ydr        192198  98304  Resource  0xD7A1647F
```

Hits print as `<archive>:<path/inside/nested.rpf/file>`, one per line, and `--json`
emits an array with the same fields plus the match offset:

```json
[
  {"archive":"<GTA V>/x64c.rpf","path":"x64c.rpf/levels/gta5/props/lev_des/lev_des.rpf/prop_paper_bag_small.ydr",
   "name":"prop_paper_bag_small.ydr","size":8193,"mem_size":24576,"kind":"resource",
   "hash":"0x167D347D","stem_hash":"0x947A8766","offset":null}
]
```

A pattern without wildcards is a substring match on the full path, so `inner.rpf`
returns the archive and everything under it. Filters combine with AND, and the
summary goes to stderr so stdout stays clean for piping.

### Extract files and nested archives

```sh
rage extract resource.rpf -o ./out                       # everything
rage extract "<GTA V>/x64e.rpf" "*/vehicles.rpf" -o ./nested   # one nested archive, as a file
rage extract "<GTA V>/x64e.rpf" "*/weapons.rpf" -o ./nested
rage extract "<GTA V>/x64b.rpf" -o ./nested --recursive  # descend into every nested rpf, to loose files
```

Retail `x64*.rpf` archives keep drawables inside nested RPFs, so a model has to
be extracted to disk before `textures` or `screenshot` can open it. `search`
tells you which nested archive holds it, and the extracted path mirrors that
archive's own folder layout (`./nested/levels/gta5/vehicles.rpf` above).

### Render a model to an image

`screenshot` frames the model automatically and renders it from any of six
fixed angles (`front`, `back`, `left`, `right`, `top`, `iso`; a view named
twice is rendered once). `--grid` collects the views into one labelled image,
always on its own dark background so the labels stay legible whatever
`--background` the renders use:

```sh
rage screenshot ./nested/models/cdimages/weapons.rpf w_ar_carbinerifle.ydr --views front,top,iso --grid
```

![Carbine rifle rendered front, top and iso](docs/images/screenshot-carbinerifle-grid.jpg)

Textures a model references but does not carry come from `--ytd`, repeatable,
earlier ones winning. A vehicle takes its own dictionary plus the shared one:

```sh
rage screenshot ./nested/levels/gta5/vehicles.rpf adder.yft --views front,left,iso --grid --ytd adder --ytd vehshare
```

![Adder rendered front, left and iso](docs/images/screenshot-adder-grid.jpg)

Textures a model asks for but no dictionary supplies are drawn flat grey and
listed by name, so the output itself tells you which `--ytd` to pass next.
Geometries whose shader names no diffuse texture at all (lights, glass) are
grey too, but counted apart as `N with no diffuse`: no dictionary will fill
those in.

A YFT is rendered as one piece: its main body, posed by the fragment's default
bone transforms, plus every physics child that carries a mesh, placed by its
physics transform. Vehicle wheels are the usual case. A YFT typically ships one
front and one rear wheel mesh; the other wheel slots borrow those and right-hand
wheels are mirrored, the same way CodeWalker fills them in. The summary line
counts the parts drawn, e.g. `5 parts (4 wheels)`. Damaged variants of a part
are not drawn.

Vehicle bodies come out white because the paint colour is not in the YFT: the
game applies it at runtime from carcols metadata. `--paint #rrggbb` tints every
geometry drawn with a `vehicle_paint*` shader and leaves glass, lights, tyres
and interiors alone:

```sh
rage screenshot ./nested/levels/gta5/vehicles.rpf adder.yft --views front,left,iso --grid --ytd adder --ytd vehshare --paint "#8b1a1a"
```

![Adder rendered in red paint](docs/images/screenshot-adder-paint-grid.jpg)

### Transparent backgrounds and translucent materials

`--background` takes `grey` (default), `transparent`, or any `#rrggbb`. With a
PNG or WebP output the alpha channel is real, so the render drops straight onto
any page. Materials keep the blend mode the game gives them: cut-out foliage is
alpha-tested, and translucent plastic or glass is blended over what sits behind it.

```sh
rage screenshot ./nested/lev_des_mp_dlc.rpf hei_prop_pill_bag_01.ydr --views front --background transparent
rage screenshot ./nested/mp_biker_weed.rpf bkr_prop_weed_lrg_01a.ydr --background transparent --ytd bkr_prop_weed
```

  <img src="docs/images/screenshot-weed-plant-transparent.png" width="360" alt="Cannabis plant with alpha-tested leaves over a transparent background">
</p>

### Export textures as images

```sh
rage textures ./nested/models/cdimages/weapons.rpf w_ar_carbinerifle.ytd            # PNGs into ./w_ar_carbinerifle
rage textures ./nested/models/cdimages/weapons.rpf w_ar_carbinerifle.ytd --sheet --max-size 256 --format webp
rage textures ./nested/levels/gta5/props/lev_des/lev_des.rpf prop_cs_heist_bag_02.ydr   # textures baked into a drawable
```

Every texture in a dictionary lands in a folder named after it. `--sheet` adds
one labelled contact sheet of the lot, with a checkerboard behind anything that
has alpha:

![Contact sheet of the carbine rifle's texture dictionary](docs/images/textures-carbinerifle-sheet.jpg)

PNG is lossless and the best default. WebP output is lossless-only, JPEG drops
the alpha channel, and `--max-size` caps the longest edge so files stay small.
The old `ytd` command still works as an alias for `textures`, and `--dds`
restores its original raw-DDS output.

### Inspect a resource file

```sh
rage resource info ./out/prop_my_thing.ydr                   # a loose file, e.g. one you just exported
rage resource info --archive "<GTA V>/x64a.rpf" binoculars.ytd
rage resource info ./out/prop_my_thing.ydr --json            # one JSON object for scripts
```

Prints the RSC7 header (version, system/graphics page flags and the sizes they
encode, whether the body is deflated or stored) and then what the file holds:
every texture of a `.ytd` in the same per-line format `textures` uses, or, for
a `.ydr`/`.ydd`/`.yft`, each drawable's bounds, LOD distances, per-LOD model,
geometry and triangle counts, the shader table with diffuse texture names, and
the embedded textures. Handy for checking an export before it goes into a
stream folder: a bad magic or a zero-triangle high LOD shows up immediately.

### Pictures for vision models

Every image command writes ordinary picture files, so a vision model can look
at a model or texture the same way you do. A model does not need more than
roughly 1500 px on the longest edge, and `--json` output from `search` gives it
a path to act on. A typical loop that finds every bag prop in the game, extracts
the archives that hold them, and renders each one looks like this:

```sh
rage search "<GTA V>" "*bag*.ydr" --json > bags.json
# extract each distinct nested archive from bags.json, then:
rage screenshot ./nested/.../mp_biker_weed.rpf bkr_prop_weed_bag_01a.ydr --size 512x512 --format jpg --ytd bkr_prop_weed
```

A full-install `*.ydr` search takes around two minutes and a single 512 px render
under two seconds, so a few hundred props are a coffee break.

### Drawable dictionaries and fragments

Entries in a `.ydd` mostly share one name — the file's own — so they are
reported and written out as `0x<hash>` instead, and that hash is what `--entry`
takes to pick one of them:

```sh
rage screenshot ./nested/some_dictionary.ydd --views front,iso        # every entry, named by hash
rage screenshot ./nested/some_dictionary.ydd --entry 0x<hash> --views front,iso
```

### Navmeshes

`.ynv` files are the pathfinding polygons peds walk on, one per 150 m grid
cell (`navmesh[X][Y].ynv`, X and Y being the cell index times three).
A custom MLO ships none, so NPCs inside it walk into the walls of whatever
stood there before. `rage navmesh` reads, fetches and rebuilds cells:

```sh
rage navmesh info "navmesh[108][96].ynv"                       # cell, bounds, polygon/edge/portal counts
rage navmesh cell --exe "<GTA V>" --at=-578,-1061 -o cell.ynv  # the cell under a world position, from whichever archive loads last
rage navmesh export cell.ynv -o cell.obj                       # polygons as OBJ (exterior/interior/sunk groups)
rage navmesh ybn-obj interior.ybn --ymap interior_milo.ymap -o collision.obj   # an MLO's collision, placed in the world
rage navmesh build cell.ynv --ybn interior.ybn --ymap interior_milo.ymap     --clip=-600,-1070,-566,-1050 --floor-z 21.25 -o "navmesh[108][96].ynv" --obj check.obj
```

`build` rasterises the collision's walkable floor onto a grid (`--grid`,
0.25 m), knocks out every cell a ped's body slab (`--body 0.15,0.45` above
the floor) would hit, merges the rest into rectangles (`--max-side`) and
appends them to the cell as interior, flat-ground polygons with proper edge
adjacency (a GTA polygon edge names exactly one neighbour, so shared edges
are split vertex for vertex). Vanilla polygons under the interior are sunk
and cut off rather than deleted, which keeps every polygon index — and so
every edge from the neighbouring cells — valid. Furniture whose collision
lives in escrowed `.ydr`s can be excluded with `--block x0,y0,x1,y1`. Drop
the result in a resource's `stream/` folder and FiveM streams it over the
game's cell.

## Keys

Retail archives are NG-encrypted, so reading them needs keys from your own game
install. Point the tool at the game once and forget about it:

```sh
export GTAV_PATH="<GTA V>"          # or the full path to GTA5.exe
rage list "<GTA V>/x64a.rpf" "*.ytd"
rage textures "<GTA V>/x64a.rpf" binoculars.ytd
```

`--exe <PATH>` does the same thing per-run and overrides the variable. Either
form takes the executable itself or the folder holding it. Recovering the keys
from the executable costs a couple of seconds, so the result is cached per
game build (keyed on the executable's size and modification time) under
`~/.rpf-cli/keys`; set `RAGE_KEYS_CACHE` to put it somewhere else. Later runs load in milliseconds,
and a game update simply produces a new entry. An unwritable cache is not an
error, the keys are just recovered every time.

To manage a copy on disk yourself, write it out once and use `--keys`, which
takes precedence over `--exe`:

```sh
rage extract-keys --exe "<GTA V>/GTA5.exe" -o ./keys
rage list --keys ./keys "<GTA V>/x64a.rpf" "*.ytd"
```

Only the AES key is still stored as plain bytes in GTA5.exe. Newer builds no
longer carry the NG keys or decrypt tables, so those are unwrapped from a
`magic.dat` compiled into the binary, using the AES key found in your
executable.

That `magic.dat` comes from CodeWalker, which generates it by deflating the NG
keys and decrypt tables, encrypting them with the AES key, and masking the
result with a seeded .NET PRNG stream. Unwrapping therefore needs an AES key
from a real game executable, so the keys stay inert without one. The key
material itself is the same across game versions — extracting once is enough.

## Updating

```sh
rage update check     # ask GitHub whether a newer release exists
rage update install   # download it and replace this binary
```

`rage` also checks for a new release passively, at most once every 24 hours,
and prints a one-line note on stderr when one is found. It only runs when
stderr is a terminal, so it never fires in scripts or CI, and it never delays
a command — it is checked in the background and only reported after your
command has finished. Disable it with `--no-update-check`, the
`RAGE_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` environment variable, or by setting `CI`. The check is
stamped in `~/.rpf-cli/update-check.json`; set `RAGE_UPDATE_CACHE` to put that
file somewhere else. Network requests go through `ureq` and honour the
standard `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`/`NO_PROXY` environment variables.

`rage update install` downloads the release asset for your platform along with
its `SHA256SUMS`, verifies the checksum, and replaces the running binary in
place — including a binary installed with `cargo install`, since both manage
the same path. It refuses to install a release published without checksums.

## Releasing

`rpf-cli` depends on the published [`rpf-archive`](https://github.com/VIRUXE/rpf-archive-rs)
crate. To build against the sibling checkout without editing `Cargo.toml`:

```sh
cargo install --path . --config 'patch.crates-io.rpf-archive.path="../rpf-archive-rs"'
```

To cut a release:

1. If a library change is needed, publish `rpf-archive` to crates.io first and
   bump the version this crate pins.
2. Bump this crate's version in `Cargo.toml` and rebuild so `Cargo.lock` follows.
3. Commit, then `gh release create vX.Y.Z --notes ...` — the tag triggers the
   `release` workflow, which builds the Linux and Windows binaries, publishes a
   `SHA256SUMS` for them, and attaches all three to that release.

The asset names (`rage-linux-x86_64`, `rage-windows-x86_64.exe`) and the
`vX.Y.Z` tag shape are a contract with `rage update`; renaming either breaks
self-update for everyone already on an installed build.

Publishing itself is a manual, deliberate step — nothing here does it for you.
